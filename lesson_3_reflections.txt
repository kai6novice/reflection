When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you're doing collaboration a project with others. when your local storage is not safe, either corrupted or don't have enough space.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because if someone updated the remote repository, and git automatically pull the changes, the changes might overwrite your local changes made in the same file.

When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
when you're doing collaboration a project with others. when your local storage is not safe, either corrupted or don't have enough space.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
because if someone updated the remote repository, and git automatically pull the changes, the changes might overwrite your local changes made in the same file.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
fork only happen in github, it links between cloned remote repository.
clones happen both in github and local. it's a way to copy an entire repository without any linkage. Unless you clone a repository from remote to local, then the clone will have a pointer, points back to remote.
branches, is a temporary clone of a repo, it will point back to the origin branch it's branch from.
